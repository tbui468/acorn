Save what I have to github
    Make a new project on github
    Add .gitignore (mainly to avoid uploading the vendor code and build code)
    Push to github

Change color to cool theme

Save and load file
    make a menu button in editor window with options: save, load
    implement save and load in editor window

Note: Editor should be mostly functional by this point

Hide windows title bar and make app full-screen
    Add an in-app imgui title bar with a close button to close the entire app

Add ability to use terminal
    read in user command and pass to terminal (need to figure out how to do this)
    then record the output and print to the terminal in the editor

Add line numbers to editor
    how can this be done?  Is there an editor widget that I could use?

Add tabs to editor

Add ability to split editor
    vertical and horizontal????

Add command and input modes
    make display showing which mode user is currently in at bottom of editor
    add basic movement controls (left, right, up down) with vim controls

Get a basic text editor working (similar to notepad)
    Window Options: No Close.  Unsaved document.
    Changing Global Alpha can make all windows semi-transparent to see glfw clear color
    find height of decoration so that we can integrate that into InputText box size (needs to be smaller by decoration size)
        Frame Padding (vertical) and font size (of decoration) can be used to find decoration height
    enter text
    save
    load
    make editor transparent (need to make glfw window transparent)
    Collapsing of windows should animate them... this could be tricky, but very cool looking!
        Go back to game design here - create variables to hold window width and animate them accordingly
    Hide window frame, and add close button to editor window - this button should shut down the app
    save to github
    make default controls similar to vim
    make tab controls similar to tmux
    animate tabs so that they scroll....?
    make the theme based on 'aliens'/80s sci fi

Why make this?  It's fun, and a lot of companies (Ubisoft, Blizzard, Nvidia, etc) use ImGui
    so the job prospects will be better than using some random thing no one knows or making my own
